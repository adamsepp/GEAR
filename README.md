  GEAR â€“ General Execution & Application Runtime
</h1>

**GEAR** is a modular C\+\+20 application framework that uses [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui),
[ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) and [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) to provide a minimal,
UI-driven interface without relying on the console.  
Itâ€™s designed as a sandbox and runtime core for experimenting with modern C++ features, GUI rendering,
real-time dashboards, and logging.

## Development

Build and debug instructions for all platforms are documented in  
ðŸ‘‰ [Docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](./Docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

---

## Tests

Unit tests use [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and run in GitHub Actions on all platforms!  
ðŸ‘‰ Details: [Docs/TESTING.md](./Docs/TESTING.md)

## Dependencies

This project uses the following main dependencies, all automatically managed via CMake's `FetchContent`:

* [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) â€” window and input management  
* [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) â€” immediate mode GUI  
* [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) â€” plotting and real-time visualization  
* [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) â€” modern formatting library  
* [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) â€” image loading for window and title bar icons  
* [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) â€” testing framework  

Additionally, a modern C++ compiler (supporting C++20) and CMake (>= 3.20) are required to build the project.
